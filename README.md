---
Exzing Technology has implemented a special kind of car hailing service that cares about the environment. We are integrating the solution with XRPL blockchain solution to enable each user that signs up to mint their carbon fingerprint as an NFT from a unique XRPL wallet. The ultimate aim includes using these NFT collections for data analytics that can help globally to fight climate change. They could also decide to monetize their data in the marketplace.
This project consists of both the lushdriver app and the lushrider app

## Problem we are solving
We noticed that a lot of users (riders and drivers) of ride-hailing apps have not idea about their impact on the environment in terms of carbon footprint or emmission. This is a serious issue considering the deteriorating effect of climate change globally. Furthermore, most drivers are groaning under the burden of huge remittances to ride-sharing app owners

## Solution
Our solution is robust an unique in the sense that it will increase users awareness right from the signup page and allthrough the driving period. So they get to monitor their carbon footprint as they take various actions to reduce it to considerable levels. We are also proposing a more competitive price regime that will see us garner huge user base in no time.

To further make the solution more encompassing we've decided to add a blockchain layer (XRPL) to enable minting of NFTs in form of their unique carbon footprint values.
